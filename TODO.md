- [ ] AI assistance in breaking down large tasks
- [ ] More sophisticated time estimation learning
- [ ] Contextual suggestions based on calendar availability

### Focus & Productivity Features
- [ ] Integration with Deep Work principles (e.g., timers, focus sessions)
- [ ] Time blocking visualization
- [ ] Task categorization as Deep/Shallow work
- [ ] Pomodoro timer integration
- [ ] Focus mode with notification blocking

### Technical Improvements
- [ ] Implement secure API key handling for Release builds (currently DEBUG only)
- [ ] Unit and UI tests for critical paths
- [ ] Accessibility improvements (VoiceOver support)
- [ ] Widget support for quick task addition
- [ ] App Intents for Siri integration

### UI/UX Refinements
- [ ] Dark mode polish
- [ ] Custom app icon options
- [ ] Haptic feedback for task actions
- [ ] Swipe gesture customization
- [ ] Task templates for recurring items

## üóìÔ∏è Google Calendar Integration (Mostly Complete)

**Phase 1: Authentication & Setup** ‚úÖ
- [x] Configure Google Cloud Project
- [x] Add `GoogleSignIn-iOS` SDK
- [x] Implement "Sign in with Google" in app
- [x] Secure token storage using Keychain

**Phase 2: Basic Calendar Interaction** ‚úÖ
- [x] Create `CalendarService.swift`
- [x] OAuth token management
- [x] List calendars functionality
- [x] Create/Update/Delete events

**Phase 3: AI Integration** ‚úÖ
- [x] Calendar tools in OpenAI service
- [x] AI can create calendar events
- [x] AI can query today's events

**Phase 4: Advanced Features** üöß
- [ ] Multi-calendar support
- [ ] Recurring event handling
- [ ] Calendar event templates
- [ ] Two-way sync with tasks

## üíª macOS Companion App (Future - Lower Priority)

- [ ] **Project Setup:** Add macOS target
- [ ] **Code Sharing:** Configure shared files
- [ ] **Authentication:** macOS-compatible Google Sign-In
- [ ] **UI/UX Adaptation:** macOS-specific layouts
- [ ] **Menu Bar:** Quick task addition from menu bar
- [ ] **Keyboard Shortcuts:** Power user features

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues to Address

- [ ] Address warning regarding required interface orientations
- [ ] Resolve any remaining `Codable` warnings
- [ ] Fix any memory leaks in long chat sessions
