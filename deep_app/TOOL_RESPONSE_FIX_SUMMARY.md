# Tool Response Fix Implementation Summary

## Overview

I've implemented several enhancements to help diagnose and potentially work around the Foundation Models tool response issue in iOS 26 beta. The core problem is that while tools ARE being called and ARE returning data, the model doesn't recognize the responses when they contain retrieved data.

## What I've Added

### 1. Enhanced Diagnostic Tool
**File:** `FoundationModelTools.swift`

The `DiagnosticTool` now supports multiple response formats:
- **plain** - Simple text response (original format)
- **json** - JSON-formatted response
- **markdown** - Markdown with headers and formatting
- **structured** - Delimited format with clear markers

Usage: `"Run diagnostic test hello with format json"`

### 2. Enhanced GetTasksTool
**File:** `FoundationModelTools.swift`

The `listCurrentTasks` tool now supports multiple response formats:
- **simple** - Very basic format: "Found X tasks: [list]"
- **json** - Full JSON representation of tasks
- **structured** - Delimited format with task count and list
- **plain** - Original formatted list

Usage: `"List current tasks with format simple"`

### 3. Experimental Task Retrieval Tool
**File:** `FoundationModelTools.swift`

New tool `experimentalGetTasks` that mimics successful tool patterns:
- **count** action - Returns simple count message like "I counted X tasks"
- **list** action - Returns conversational list format
- **check** action - Ultra-simple "Empty list" or "Has X tasks"

Usage: `"Use experimental tool to count tasks"`

### 4. Automated Diagnostic Test
**File:** `ChatViewModel.swift`

Added a special command that runs through all diagnostic tests automatically:
- Type: `"Test local model tools"` in the chat
- Only works when local model is enabled
- Runs through all formats and tools systematically
- Provides summary of what worked/failed

### 5. Documentation

Created comprehensive documentation:
- **FoundationModelsToolTestingGuide.md** - Step-by-step testing guide
- **TOOL_RESPONSE_FIX_SUMMARY.md** - This summary
- Updated **FoundationModelsToolResponseIssue.md** - Added new solutions

## How to Test

### Quick Test (Automated)
1. Enable local model in Settings
2. In chat, type: "Test local model tools"
3. Watch as it runs through all diagnostic tests
4. Check which formats (if any) show proper responses

### Manual Testing
Try these commands with different formats:
```
"Run diagnostic test hello with format json"
"List current tasks with format simple"
"Use experimental tool to count tasks"
```

### What to Look For

**Success indicators:**
- Model echoes back diagnostic messages
- Model mentions specific task counts
- Model shows task descriptions

**Failure indicators:**
- "I can't see your tasks"
- "I don't have access"
- Model ignores tool response data

## Theory Behind the Fixes

1. **Format Testing** - Different response formats might be parsed differently
2. **Simplified Responses** - Mimicking successful tools like `addTaskToList`
3. **Conversational Style** - Using natural language instead of structured data
4. **Minimal Data** - Reducing response complexity

## Next Steps

1. Run the diagnostic to see if any format works
2. If a format works, update all tools to use that format
3. Monitor iOS 26 beta updates for framework fixes
4. Consider implementing response interceptors if possible

## Known Limitations

- This is a workaround for an iOS 26 beta bug
- Even if a format works, it may be unreliable
- The real fix needs to come from Apple
- OpenAI remains the most reliable option for now

## Debug Output

Watch console for:
```
DEBUG [ToolName]: Tool called with...
DEBUG [ToolName]: Returning response...
DEBUG [AppleFoundationService]: Response content...
```

This helps verify tools are executing even if responses aren't recognized.
