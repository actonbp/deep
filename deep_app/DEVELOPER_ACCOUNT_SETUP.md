# Setting Up Your Paid Developer Account in Xcode

## Current Issue
You're seeing provisioning profile errors because Xcode is still using your "Personal Team" which doesn't support CloudKit.

## Solution: Switch to Your Paid Developer Team

### 1. Verify Your Developer Account
- Go to [developer.apple.com](https://developer.apple.com)
- Sign in with your Apple ID
- Verify you see "Apple Developer Program" membership

### 2. Update Xcode Settings
1. Open Xcode
2. Go to **Xcode > Settings** (Cmd+,)
3. Click **Accounts** tab
4. Select your Apple ID
5. Click **Download Manual Profiles**
6. You should see TWO teams:
   - "Your Name (Personal Team)" 
   - "Your Name" or your organization name (Paid Team)

### 3. Update Project Signing
1. Select `deep_app` project in navigator
2. Select `deep_app` target
3. Go to **Signing & Capabilities** tab
4. Change **Team** dropdown from Personal to your Paid team
5. Bundle Identifier should update (might add a team prefix)

### 4. Troubleshooting

#### "No profiles for 'com.bryanacton.deep' were found"
- This is normal! Click **Try Again**
- Xcode will create new profiles automatically

#### Still seeing "Personal Team"?
1. Sign out of Xcode: Accounts > minus button
2. Sign back in
3. Download profiles again
4. Restart Xcode

#### CloudKit container issues?
- The container ID might change from `iCloud.com.bryanacton.deep` to `iCloud.TEAMID.com.bryanacton.deep`
- This is OK! Xcode handles it automatically

### 5. Verify Success
- Build and run the app
- Check console for "☁️ iCloud is available"
- No more provisioning errors!
