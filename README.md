# Bryan's Brain (deep_app)

## üö¶ Development Status
- **Current Branch**: `feature/image-upload` ‚úÖ **Major improvements just pushed** (June 29, 2025)
- **Stable Branch**: `main` (warning-free, production-ready)  
- **Latest Commit**: `8ef7e9f` - Major UI/UX improvements and AI Agent Mode
- **Previous**: `edb7e1f` - ChatGPT-style image upload feature
- **üìñ Branch Guide**: See [BRANCH_GUIDE.md](BRANCH_GUIDE.md) for detailed git workflow

An iOS app integrating an AI chat assistant (powered by OpenAI's `gpt-4o`, `gpt-4o-mini`, and `o3` models) with a functional to-do list and Google Calendar integration. The core motivation is to provide a **fluid, conversational interface for task management and planning**, specifically designed to reduce friction for users with ADHD.

## Core Concept: Conversational & Agentic Productivity

The app goes beyond a simple chatbot. It leverages an **agentic AI architecture** where the AI assistant can:

1.  **Understand** user requests in natural language.
2.  **Reason** about the user's goals and the current context (tasks, conversation history).
3.  **Plan** sequences of actions.
4.  **Utilize Tools** autonomously (via OpenAI function calling / tool use) to interact with the app's features, such as:
    *   Managing the To-Do List (`addTaskToList`, `listCurrentTasks`, `updateTaskPriorities`, etc.)
    *   Managing Calendar Events (`createCalendarEvent`, reading events)
    *   Updating Task Metadata (`updateTaskEstimatedDuration`)

This allows for a seamless experience where task capture, planning, and calendar integration happen within a single conversational flow.

**Future Vision: Multi-Agent Collaboration:** The ultimate goal is to evolve towards a system potentially involving multiple specialized AI agents working in parallel. These agents could proactively analyze the chat, to-do list, and calendar to offer suggestions, identify conflicts, assist with time blocking (aligning with methodologies like Cal Newport's), and maintain alignment across the user's productivity landscape.

## Benefits for ADHD

*   **Low-Friction Capture:** Simply talking or typing to the AI assistant removes the barrier of opening specific apps, navigating menus, and manually entering task details.
*   **Reduced Cognitive Load:** The AI handles organizing, prioritizing (with guidance), and potentially scheduling tasks, freeing up mental energy.
*   **Externalized Structure:** Time blocking suggestions and calendar integration provide the external structure that can be highly beneficial for managing time blindness and transitions.
*   **Action-Oriented:** The AI is designed to gently guide towards the next actionable step.

## Current Features
