# Bryan's Brain (deep_app)

An iOS app integrating an AI chat assistant (powered by OpenAI's `gpt-4o-mini`) with a functional to-do list and Google Calendar integration. The core motivation is to provide a **fluid, conversational interface for task management and planning**, specifically designed to reduce friction for users with ADHD.

## Core Concept: Conversational & Agentic Productivity

The app goes beyond a simple chatbot. It leverages an **agentic AI architecture** where the AI assistant can:

1.  **Understand** user requests in natural language.
2.  **Reason** about the user's goals and the current context (tasks, conversation history).
3.  **Plan** sequences of actions.
4.  **Utilize Tools** autonomously (via OpenAI function calling / tool use) to interact with the app's features, such as:
    *   Managing the To-Do List (`addTaskToList`, `listCurrentTasks`, `updateTaskPriorities`, etc.)
    *   Managing Calendar Events (`createCalendarEvent`, reading events)
    *   Updating Task Metadata (`updateTaskEstimatedDuration`)

This allows for a seamless experience where task capture, planning, and calendar integration happen within a single conversational flow.

**Future Vision: Multi-Agent Collaboration:** The ultimate goal is to evolve towards a system potentially involving multiple specialized AI agents working in parallel. These agents could proactively analyze the chat, to-do list, and calendar to offer suggestions, identify conflicts, assist with time blocking (aligning with methodologies like Cal Newport's), and maintain alignment across the user's productivity landscape.

## Benefits for ADHD

*   **Low-Friction Capture:** Simply talking or typing to the AI assistant removes the barrier of opening specific apps, navigating menus, and manually entering task details.
*   **Reduced Cognitive Load:** The AI handles organizing, prioritizing (with guidance), and potentially scheduling tasks, freeing up mental energy.
*   **Externalized Structure:** Time blocking suggestions and calendar integration provide the external structure that can be highly beneficial for managing time blindness and transitions.
*   **Action-Oriented:** The AI is designed to gently guide towards the next actionable step.

## Current Features

*   **iOS Application:** Built natively using SwiftUI.
*   **Tabbed Interface:** Separate views for Chat, To-Do List, Calendar, Scratchpad, and Roadmap.
*   **AI Chat:**
    *   Connects to OpenAI's `gpt-4o-mini` model.
    *   Conversation starter prompts.
*   **To-Do List:**
    *   Add, toggle completion, delete, prioritize, drag-reorder items.
    *   Display estimated task durations.
    *   Expandable task metadata (category, project/path, difficulty).
    *   Persisted locally and **synced across devices via CloudKit**.
*   **CloudKit Sync (New!):**
    *   Automatic sync of all tasks across iPhone, iPad, and Mac.
    *   Syncs task content, completion status, priorities, and metadata.
    *   Supports add, update, and delete operations.
    *   **Auto-sync on app lifecycle** - syncs when entering foreground/background.
    *   **Visual sync status indicators** - see sync status in real-time.
    *   **Manual refresh button** - force sync when needed.
    *   **Smart error handling** - handles duplicate saves gracefully.
    *   Requires iCloud account and internet connection.
*   **Google Calendar Integration:**
    *   Secure Google Sign-In authentication.
    *   View today's calendar events in a dedicated tab.
*   **üéÆ Gamified Roadmap View:**
    *   Interactive "quest map" visualization with project islands.
    *   Tasks displayed as quest dots with progress rings around islands.
    *   Level system (Lv 1-5) based on project complexity.
    *   XP system (10 points per completed task).
    *   Achievement badges for major milestones.
    *   Zoom/pan controls for exploration.
    *   Beautiful sky gradient background with connecting bridges.
*   **Notes/Scratchpad:**
    *   Quick capture for ideas and notes.
    *   Local persistence.
*   **Agentic AI Capabilities:**
    *   Uses tools (`addTaskToList`, `listCurrentTasks`, `removeTaskFromList`, `updateTaskPriorities`, `updateTaskEstimatedDuration`, `createCalendarEvent`) triggered by conversation.
    *   AI can estimate task durations and difficulty levels.
    *   AI can assist with time blocking suggestions (asking user for calendar constraints).
    *   AI can create events in the user's primary Google Calendar upon request.
    *   AI can mark tasks as complete.
*   **Secure API Key Handling (Debug):** Uses `Secrets.plist`.

## Planned Features / Roadmap

*   **Enhanced CloudKit Sync:**
    *   Real-time sync without app restart.
    *   Notes/Scratchpad sync.
    *   Conflict resolution for simultaneous edits.
*   **Calendar Creation Enhancement:** Allow AI to create events based on time blocking suggestions.
*   **UI/UX:** Improve Dark Mode support, general UI polish.
*   **Task Metadata:** Add Deep/Shallow work categorization.
*   **AI Enhancement:** Refine prompts, explore multi-agent concepts more deeply.
*   **Release Build Security:** Secure API key handling for release.
*   **macOS Companion App:** Explore creating a companion app for macOS leveraging the shared SwiftUI codebase (lower priority currently).

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Repository Recovery Warning

**Before performing ANY git reset, checkout, or major recovery operations:**

1. **Read `.cursor/rules/feature_verification.mdc`** - Contains comprehensive checklist
2. **Create a backup**: `git stash push -m "Safety backup"`
3. **Never trust file presence alone** - Features can be missing even when files exist
4. **Always verify the expandable task metadata feature** - It's been lost before!

See `.cursor/rules/feature_verification.mdc` for the complete verification protocol.
